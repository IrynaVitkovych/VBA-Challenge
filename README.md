Module 2 Assignment to Analyze Multiple Year Stock Data (2018, 2019, 2020) using VBA scripting. The created VBA script will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
	
 	1	The ticker symbol
	2	Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end.
	3	The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end.
	4	The total stock volume of the stock.
	5	The Greatest % increase among all data
	6	The Greatest % decrease among all data
	7	The Greatest total volume among all data
 
The VBA script can run on all sheets in the file.
I've attached a file with the VBA script for you to look over.
Because of the big size of original exel file - "Multiple_year_stock_data", I coudn't download it here, but I attached smaller file which called "alphabetical_testing" in resource folder.  
In screenshoot folder attched three files with resultes of using the vba script in "Multiple_year_stock_data" file, which can not be uploded here.
While working on this module I used Google, Xpert Learning Assistant, and tutor session which helped me build the code.
